Community Explorer v.2 beta
===========================

## Setting up the server

### Running it directly [for development]
See `doc/dev_setup.md`

### Running it wrapped in docker [for production]
Prerequisites:
  - `docker`
  - `docker-compose` (>= v. 1.7.0)  

##### 1) Get the app
```
git clone https://github.com/moma/comex2.git
```

##### 2) Set up the doors connection
```
nano config/parametres_comex.ini
```
The environment variable `DOORS_HOST` must simply be set to your doors server's hostname or IP, and `DOORS_PORT` to the doors server's exposed port, or none if it's ports 80/443.


##### 3) Run the docker
```
# prepare the data/ directory (or copy one if you already have data)
mkdir data/shared_mysql_data

# prepare the logs/ directory
mkdir logs

# build the components
cd setup/dockers
sudo docker-compose build

# run them and link them
sudo docker-compose up
# at this point your comex app is available on http://localhost:8080
#               your sql data will always be in data
#               and logs are under logs/services.log
```

#### Nginx
We ask nginx to reverse-proxy our app

This is a minimal conf:

```
# nginx exemple
server {
    listen 80;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://0.0.0.0:8080;
    }
}
```
See the [detailed doc](https://github.com/moma/comex2/blob/master/doc/nginx_conf.md) and a [typical production conf file](https://github.com/moma/comex2/blob/master/setup/comex2_deployed_outer.nginx.conf) for a real-life configuration example.

```
# the app is then accessible directly on localhost
# here is the operational schema

          your-server:80 or :443

```

In production, you may want to have the app run at boot. In that case, see the [startup script doc](https://github.com/moma/comex2/blob/master/doc/startup_script.md) on this subject.

## About the data

All user data and keywords list and occurrences are in a MySQL database in the app's directory **`data/shared_mysql_data`**,

Uploaded images are in `data/shared_user_img`.

### DB structure

##### Overview
  - the DB name is *`comex_shared`*  
  - `scholars` is the main table:
     - a local user id (aka **luid**) is the primary key
     - a unique external doors_uid (the user id for the entire lab)
     - a unique email
  - we have four related tables
    - `orgs` for labs and institutions
      - and sch_org for scholars <=> organisms mapping
    - `keywords`
      - and `sch_kw` for scholars <=> keywords mapping
    - `hashtags`
      - and `sch_ht` for scholars <=> hashtags mapping
    - `linked_ids` for other ids of the researcher (eg: [ORCID](http://orcid.org/), not used yet)

##### More info
Full table structure is described in [this documentation file](https://github.com/moma/comex2/blob/master/doc/table_specifications.md).

Some common maintenance operations have example scripts in the `setup/toolbox` folder.

##### Exemple queries
```SQL

-- ==========================
-- FOR SCHOLAR + AFFILIATIONS
-- ==========================
SELECT
    scholars.*,
    orgs.*
FROM scholars
LEFT JOIN sch_org
    ON luid = sch_org.uid
JOIN orgs
    ON orgs.orgid = sch_org.orgid ;

-- NB: scholars <=> orgs is a one-to-many relationship
--     so this can return multiple lines
--  => in the app we use GROUP_CONCAT(orgs.label) or GROUP_CONCAT(orgs.toarray)
--     to fit in the scholars cardinality)


-- ==================================
-- FOR SCHOLAR + KEYWORDS IN ONE LINE
-- ==================================
SELECT
    scholars.*,
    COUNT(keywords.kwid) AS keywords_nb,
    GROUP_CONCAT(kwstr) AS keywords_list
FROM scholars
JOIN sch_kw
    ON luid = uid
JOIN keywords
    ON sch_kw.kwid = keywords.kwid
GROUP BY uid ;
```

### User and registration service
The comex app was refactored and merged in dec 2016 with a new registration form server

  - the form is served by [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and uses [javascript functions](https://github.com/moma/comex2/blob/master/static/js/comex_reg_form_controllers.js) for validation etc  
  - the registration credentials are transmitted to an authentication portal: Doors prototype  
  - the answers are POSTed back to server that writes new users in a local DB

### Project History Overview
This project first started as a side-project of the EU FET Funded TINA project (2009-2011) coordinated by David Chavalarias (CNRS). It was endorsed by the Complex Systems Institute of Paris Ile-de-France (ISC-PIF), the Complex Systems Society and the French National Network for Complex Systems.

The development have been conducted under the scientific supervision of David Chavalarias :
-  The core of the plateform is based on the TinawebJS online bipartite graph visualization software developed at CNRS/ISC-PIF by Julian Bilke (2009-2011) and Samuel Castillo (2012-2015).
- The community explorer was refactored by Romain Loth (CNRS/ISC-PIF) in 2016-2017 for a more flexible deployment and better user interface.
- The community explorer use the DOORS platform for user identification (https://github.com/ISCPIF/doors)
