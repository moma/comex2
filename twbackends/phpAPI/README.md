## Related Documents PHP backend

##### Provides an API for "topPapers" search queries in tinawebJS

These php files provide access to a CSV or sqlite database as an ajax endpoint for a "related documents" search in tinawebJS client.

Main use case is support for one-doc-by-row CSV files.


#### Prerequisites

You need any kind of php server support with php > 5.0.

For instance on an ubuntu 16 with an nginx server, I'd install php 7 fpm:
```
sudo apt install php7.0-fpm
```

And then add this kind of configuration entry in `nginx.conf`:
```
location ~ \.php$ {
  include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
  fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock;

 fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME
   /your/path/to/twbackends/phpAPI/$fastcgi_script_name;
 # --------------------------------
}
```

It's enough to run any kind of gargantext-style gexf + CSV sets.

Optionally, especially in production, you should add memcached support for faster CSV search (it allows caching the CSV postings base).

```
sudo apt install php-memcached
sudo service php7.0-fpm restart
```

For legacy cortext-style databases, you'll also need sqlite:
```
sudo apt install sqlite3 php7.0-sqlite3
```


#### Usage

###### Configuration

To use the API for the "topPapers" embedded search in ProjectExplorer, the corresponding settings should be picked either:
  - via the interface (side panel menu)
  - or directly in settings_explorerjs.js:
```
TWConf.relatedDocsType = "wosLocalDB"
```

Finally, to match the correct DB with the correct graph file:
  - both should reside in `data/yoursubdir`
  - the appropriate source database information needs to appear in `db.json` in order to associate the graph source file (eg gexf) with this related docs API:
```json
"data/yoursubdir": {
      "dbname":"your.sqlite.db",
      "title":"yourDocumentTitlesTable",
      "date":"yourDocumentPubDatesTable",
      "abstract":"yourDocumentContentsTable",
      "gexfs": {
          "your.graph.gexf": {
              "semantic": { "table":"yourTableWithTerms"},
              "social": { "table":"yourTableWithSocialNodes"}
          }
      }
}
```
